# A tic-tac-toe fun little tic-tac-toe game.

## The stack

### Backend
- Used haskell to build the backend engine.
- The project was bootstrapped using stack, a set of very useful tools for haskell development.
- HSpec was used for testing.
- Exposed the necessary endpoint with Wai, a basic haskell web server.

### Frontend
- React as a front-end framework.
- Redux for state management.
- Typescript to provide typing to the whole app.

## Usage
- If you have docker installed just run `docker-compose up`
- You will then be able to see the app at `http://localhost:3000/`
